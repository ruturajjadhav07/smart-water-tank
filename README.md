# Smart Water Tank with IoT

## Overview
This project is a **Smart Water Tank Monitoring System** that uses **IoT technology** to measure and display real-time water levels on a **live dashboard**. It ensures efficient water management and helps prevent overflows or shortages.

## Features
- **Real-time Water Level Monitoring** using IoT sensors
- **Live Dashboard** for visualizing water levels
- **Automated Alerts** for low/high water levels
- **Wireless Connectivity** for remote monitoring
- **Energy Efficient** design

## Hardware Requirements
- Ultrasonic/Float Sensor for water level measurement
- Raspberry Pi for IoT connectivity
- Wi-Fi Module for cloud communication
- Water Tank
- Power Supply

## Software Requirements
- Python for Raspberry Pi programming
- Django for backend and frontend development

## Installation & Setup
1. **Hardware Setup**
   - Install the water level sensor inside the tank
   - Connect the sensor to the Raspberry Pi
   - Ensure proper power supply connections

2. **Software Configuration**
   - Set up Raspberry Pi with the necessary libraries
   - Connect the device to Wi-Fi
   - Set up MQTT/Firebase for data transmission

3. **Dashboard Deployment** (Django-Based)
   - Install Django and required dependencies
   - Configure Django settings for IoT data handling
   - Deploy the Django server and access the live dashboard

## Live Dashboard
- Displays real-time water levels using Djangoâ€™s built-in frontend features
- Graphical representation of water consumption trends
- Alerts for predefined water level thresholds

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with mobile apps for notifications
- AI-based water usage predictions
- Solar-powered IoT module for sustainability
